# Svelte test app
Svelte is a free and open-source front end JavaScript framework created by Rich Harris. It is a framework friendly to journalists and it can be used to create highly interactive pages or complex visualizations.

This project was implemented and polished based on the tutorial from [MDN web doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_getting_started)
